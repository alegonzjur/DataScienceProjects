# DataScienceProjects

This repository contains a collection of personal Data Science projects. I explore different techniques, algorithms and tools to resolve real world issues and improve my skills.

## Repository Content

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (*EDA*)**: Each project will feature a minor or detailed exploratory data analysis focused on data cleaning, transformation, preparation and visualization of the data. This improves model performance and allows me to gain insights into the dataset.

- **Machine Learning**: Implementations of supervised and unsupervised learning models (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).
  
- **Deep Learning**: Exploit the neural nets potential to improve other models.

- **Natural Language Processing (*NLP*)**: Text analysis projects with NLP techniques.

- **App Integration**: Some models will be integrated into applications to facilitate their use.

## Tools:

- **Languages**: Python. In a near future, I want to develop projects with R.

- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, LightGBM, XGBoost. Environments will be uploaded.

- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, Google Colab.
